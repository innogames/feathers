**Note:** Feathers is in beta (so there is no "stable version" yet), but 1.0 is very, very near. The latest version of Feathers requires Starling Framework 1.3, which hasn't been officially released yet, but you can download the latest [Starling source code from Github](https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework).
